Within sub folder PyCitySchools you will find a jupyter notebook named PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb.  

This is the entire notebook for the assigment including a header at the top that includes the written analysis.  

I did end up researching and including a simple filter to remove the many FutureWarnings just so the data/results looks cleaner.
